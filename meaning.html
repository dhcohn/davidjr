      <h3>Let's say  &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; and &lsquo;C&rsquo; are units of meaning.  They could be words, phrases, signs, whatever. But they each have a function in language, which operates according to different rules in different situations, like games.  This was an insight from Ludwig Wittgenstein.  But the rules are a little open-ended and the limits of the game are a little unclear.  I don't walk into a classroom for instance and tell everyone that I'm ready to play the teaching game.  Meaning is a little slippery since &lsquo;A&rsquo; can mean &lsquo;B&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; can mean &lsquo;C&rsquo;, just like the fact that when you open up a dictionary and see the word, &lsquo;rhinoceros,&rsquo; it doesn't just say &lsquo;rhinoceros,&rsquo; in the definition.  Instead, it gives a list of other words, which are also somewhere else in the dictionary.  And round and round like that so that no unit of meaning is itself.  So what holds everything in place?  And how do we communicate?  All good questions!</h3>

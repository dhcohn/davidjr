      <h3>We have found David Junior to have, like all of us, a strange relationship with the world as a whole.  Getting enough distance from it so you can see it means ceasing to be.  The philosopher Sartre made this observation: &quot;there is only being, outside of that: nothing&quot;</h3>

      <h3>We have found David Junior following his desires round and round but the principle at the center of this orbit is blocked by his own reflection.  David Junior's relationship to others is certainly complicated.  The psychoanalyst Lacan declared that there is an invisible asexual center to even the most sexual dreams.</h3>

      <h3>We have found David Junior embodying a philosophy which takes itself as its own object.  The difference between you and me is yet again different--- faith must sacrifice itself for its own lack of referent.</h3>

      <h3>The philosopher Baudrillard described the phases of the images that end up with all reality being its own representation.</h3>

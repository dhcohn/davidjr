      <h3>There are some people who still believe that the <a href ="http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/" target="_blank">earth is flat</a> and while they are somewhat misguided, their belief is incidentally a correct one.  But this is because the whole universe is flat.  It is only a surface, or more accurately an infinite surface twisted in on itself in a mobius fashion, much like David Junior's personality.  The twist is not in one place though.  Instead, it is at every location such that the whole thing is inside-out and such that each point is already somewhere else.  What the jibber-jabber does this mean for you and me?  Follow David Junior and he'll explain.<h3><img src="img/mobiusuniverse.jpg" border="2"/>

      <h3>If &lsquo;A&rsquo; means something even though it is different from itself, this is because it connects to different bits of meaning in one of those langauge games.  Like we said, &lsquo;A&rsquo; is &lsquo;B&rsquo; is &lsquo;C&rsquo; and so on.  In math, sets are groups of numbers that, even if they are endless, have an inside and an outside.  For instance, if I described a set that contained all even numbers, which would go on forever, I could still say that the number 3 is outside of that set.  Because those language games are fuzzy, there is no real outside to the whole world of language (there is no border), so meaning is sort of like a set but also sort of not like a set.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox" target="_blank">Paradoxically</a>, &lsquo;A&rsquo; is itself again.  This problem was part of a discussion between our friend Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, who mentioned this problem as it relates to sets.  He proposed the set of sets that do not contain themselves, which is a problem because this wacky group must include itself and also not include itself.  Uh-oh. The rule that governs this crazy 2-dimensional world we live in, call it &lsquo;k&rsquo;, is actually not in the two-dimensional world.  The rules of language cannot be spoken!  k, which is like the rule that governs how much A is either different or has stayed the same is never here, but is deferred into the future.  If we call this deferral or difference &lsquo;d&rsquo;, then we can say that k=d.  And since for something to be different from itself it must at some point have been itself, d is a function of sameness, which we can call &lsquo;r&rsquo;</h3>

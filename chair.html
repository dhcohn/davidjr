      <h3>This is David Junior's favorite chair to sit in.  It is 2-dimensional, which is clear from the fact that it is on a screen.  Are you seeing one chair from different angles or many different chairs?  If you are indeed seeing the same chair, this is because you are stringing together many surfaces and experiencing them as a depth.  The question then becomes about you and not the chair.  It is not so much that one chair is spinning but that you are one unified you. You have always been two-dimensional, just like David Junior.  The third dimension, which we all enjoy occupying, is just a group of imaginary strings that connect all the different forms of you, and me, and David Junior together.  Are we all in our own imaginary worlds then, just surfing our own private dream-worlds or interwebs?   Of course not, that's ridiculous.  But explaining how we stay the same and interact with eachother in a sea of constant change is where it gets tricky.  To understand this, we will need to understand some philosophy and mathematics.  When you find David Junior sitting in his chair your journey will be over.</h3>

      <h3>So language functions like a game, and the rules are always changing along with different bits of meaning. There is a way to mathemetically describe the idea that the only constant is change, that the difference between &lsquo;A&rsquo; and itself and the difference between &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; along with all other differences in between, are also different from themselves. This constant is known as &lsquo;e&rsquo;.  The &#8706; symbol means difference.   &lsquo;d&rsquo; here means deferral, which is like the bit of time between &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;.  &lsquo;r&rsquo; here means relationality, which is like the amount that &lsquo;A&rsquo; is still connected to itself (sometimes called trace in philosophy).  You can think of &lsquo;r&rsquo; as the amount that you are still you when going from one surface to another.  You can think of &lsquo;d&rsquo; as the amount you change when you pursue another surface out of some desire.  The equation is r=ke^d where k is any value that stays the same.</h3>
